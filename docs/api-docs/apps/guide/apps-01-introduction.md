# Introduction to Building Apps

BigCommerce's powerful APIs, SDKs, and toolkits let developers build apps that BigCommerce merchants can install on their stores. If you'd like to sell your app or make it available free of charge, you can submit it to our Marketplace team for approval so that any BigCommerce merchant can find and install it on our [Apps Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps). This is the first in a series of articles intended to guide you through the process of building apps for BigCommerce stores, particularly _single-click apps_. 

If you already have experience developing for BigCommerce, feel free to [skip ahead](#next-step) or check out the [quick start tutorial](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/quick-start).

## About single-click apps

Merchants discover, manage, and interact with single-click apps from the convenience of their stores' control panels.

### Discovery
Our app [Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) lists public apps that have cleared our approval process. Starting from their store's control panel, a merchant can browse or search for the app that best meets their needs, purchase it if payment is required, and install or reinstall the app on demand.

### Management
Merchants manage their installed apps in their store control panel's **Apps** menu view. Store owners and authorized users can launch the app, and store owners can also uninstall the app. Store owners can add and remove authorized users in the **Account Settings** **>** **Users** view, by clicking the three dots in the action column of the user's listing and enabling that app in the dialog that appears.

### Display
When a merchant clicks an installed app's listing or **Launch** button in the **Apps** sub-menu, BigCommerce makes a request to the app's `GET /load` endpoint and populates the **Apps** menu view with the markup it receives in response.

## Use cases
What can developers help merchants and technology partners do with BigCommerce apps?

### Integrate with business systems
Use [BigCommerce APIs](/api-reference) to integrate merchant stores with core business systems, including but not limited to the following:
* [ERP systems](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/erp/)
* [Order management platforms](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/catalog-order-management/)
* [Accounting software](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/accounting-tax/)

### Coordinate external sales and marketing channels
List and manage products on multiple [sales channels](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/sales-channels/), including marketplaces, point-of-sale systems, and both third-party and BigCommerce storefronts.  Manage channel-based pricing, external order fulfillment, and ads and social marketing placements using the [Channels Toolkit](/api-docs/channels/guide/channels-toolkit-reference).

### Automate complex script management
Programmatically add scripts with merchant-customizable variables using our [Scripts API](/api-reference/store-management/scripts) and [Script Manager](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Using-Script-Manager).

[Learn more about creating scripts](/api-docs/store-management/scripts).

### Design dynamic widgets
Build [widgets](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Page-Builder#builder), or storefront content blocks, that merchants can install and configure to display store and third-party content to their customers.
